    /// At times, the state of a signal line can change on the serial port. For example, when the break state is enabled on the serial port causing data transmission to stop. The event is reported by invoking the app-implemented PinChanged event handler. That event handler's parameter is a PinChangedEventArgs object. Inspect the PinChange property to determine the type of signal line. Those values are defined in the SerialPinChange enumeration.
